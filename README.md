# bokeh-experiments

this is the second version of the app, now rewritten in svelte 5.

the generated site is on [my github pages](http://lucianoratamero.github.io/bokeh-experiments/), which runs on github pages (based on the dist folder)

if you have any questions, just open an issue and I'll answer it when I can :)

## Getting started

```bash
# install dependencies - while svelte 5 is not released, we need to force the install
npm install --force
# start the dev server
npm run dev
# build to production
npm run build
```
