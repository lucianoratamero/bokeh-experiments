# bokeh-experiments

this is the second version of the app, now rewritten in svelte 5.

the generated site is on [my github pages](http://lucianoratamero.github.io/bokeh-experiments/), which runs on github pages (based on the dist folder)

if you have any questions, just open an issue and I'll answer it when I can :)

## Getting started

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
# start webpack-dev-server and compiler
npm run dev
# build to the dist folder
npm run build
# or deploy it to github pages
npm run deploy
```
